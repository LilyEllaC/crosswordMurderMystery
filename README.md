# crosswordMurderMystery
This is a game where you try to find the name of the murderer by searching around a house and finding the answers to the crossword clues (e.g. What is hidden next to the chair?).  After all the clues are found certain letters from the crossword will be highlighted and these will unscramble to form a name.
